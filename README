Various apps for handling/processing Siemens formatted raw scanner
files.

The 'mdh' denotes the Siemens 'Medical Data Header'.

NOTE:
To compile, you will need the following includes from Siemens, specifically
the IDEA environment:

o mdh64.h
o SeqDefines.h

These are NOT distrubuted in this repo. Add where necessary to the 
'includelib' dir of each app.

OTHER DEPENDENCIES:

o GNU Scientific Library:

	sudo apt-get install libgsl0-dev

o Little Template Library:

Also, for 'mdh_process' you will also need the 'Little Template Library',
ltl, available here:

	http://www.mpe.mpg.de/~drory/ltl/index.html

(If you do a default configure / make / sudo make install, you might need
to also do

	sudo chmod 775 /usr/local/include/ltl
	cd /usr/local/include/ltl
	sudo find . -type d -exec chmod o+r,o+x {} \;

after installation of ltl)
